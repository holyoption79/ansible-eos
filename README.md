## Deprecation Notice

Ansible 2.1 ships with great new networking
[modules](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html#eos)
purpose-built for Arista EOS. Due to the easy-to-use nature of these modules,
and their great flexibility, it is no longer recommended to use the arista.eos
role.

Get started by checking out the latest [Arista solution](https://eos.arista.com/arista-ansible-getting-started).
